üéµ **skNBS ‚Äì Skript Addon for NoteBlockAPI**
---
skNBS is a Skript addon that integrates NoteBlockAPI with Skript, allowing you to load .nbs songs, create playlists, and control playback directly from Skript.

üì¶ **Installation**
*   Install Skript on your Spigot/Paper server.
*   Install NoteBlockAPI.
*   Place `sknbs.jar` into your `/plugins` folder.
*   Restart the server.

üìñ **Syntax & Usage**
---
üé∂ **Songs**
Load an `.nbs` song from the `plugins/NoteBlockAPI/songs` folder:
`set {_song} to nbs song from "test.nbs"`

üìë **Playlists**
Create a playlist from multiple songs:
`set {_song1} to nbs song from "intro.nbs"`
`set {_song2} to nbs song from "loop.nbs"`
`set {_playlist} to nbs playlist from {_song1} and {_song2}`

‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Playback Types**
*   **Radio**: Plays directly to players (no location).
    *   `play radio nbs {_song} to all players`
    *   `play radio nbs {_playlist} to player`
*   **Position**: Plays from a location in the world with a range.
    *   `play position nbs {_song} at location of player with range 32 to all players`
*   **NoteBlock**: Plays from a specific NoteBlock.
    *   `play noteblock nbs {_song} at target block with range 16 to {_p}`
*   **Entity**: Plays from an entity (follows the entity).
    *   `play entity nbs {_playlist} at {_mob} with range 24 to all players`

‚èØÔ∏è **Controls**
Pause, resume, or stop a SongPlayer:
*   `pause nbs {_player}`
*   `resume nbs {_player}`
*   `stop nbs {_player}`

‚è© **Seeking**
Skip forwards or backwards in a song/playlist by seconds:
*   `forward 10 seconds in nbs {_player}` `# skip ahead 10s`
*   `rewind 5 seconds in nbs {_player}` `# rewind 5s`

‚ö†Ô∏è **Notes**
*   Songs must be placed in `/plugins/NoteBlockAPI/songs/`.
*   SongPlayer objects are returned when you start playback, so keep them in variables if you want to pause/seek later.
*   Playlists currently don‚Äôt support seeking between songs.
